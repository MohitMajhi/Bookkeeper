NEW YORK CITY

"If you want to leave you should hurry, it is going to start raining soon!" Alferd said as he looked outside the glass doors. Outside the clouds seemed pitch black and
even at the late noon hour of 4 when the sun is usually high up  in the sky it seemed like night would envelop every thing in a  matter of few seconds.

"Bella and Andrew must be waiting for you" , Alfred again prompted Elina who was the newest member of his small but well respected cafe the Kings Brew and Alfred always 
took it upon himself to care well for his employees. 

"I would leave but he is not here yet" , Elina replied. 

"Is it good?" , Elina said as she put down the cup of warm coffee on the table. 

"Could be better", said the young boy putting down the book to take a sip of the coffee. 

Elina sat down on the chair opposite to the boy.
